This book provides basic reading material for an introduction to data analysis.
It uses R to handle, plot and analyze data. 
After covering the use of R for data wrangling and plotting, the book introduces key concepts of data analysis from a Bayesian and a frequentist tradition.
This text is intended for use as a first introduction to statistics for an audience with some affinity towards programming, but no prior exposition to R.

<!-- ## Testing / Showcasing -->

<!-- Don't pay too much attention to what is written here. -->

<!-- ### Quotes -->

<!-- This is a quote: -->

<!-- > Tidy datasets [...] have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. -->
<!-- > -->
<!-- > --- @wickham2014 -->

<!-- ### Infobox -->

<!-- At certain stages, possibly at the end of chapters or after important concepts, we might want to use a special infobox (see `.infobox` in `styles.css`) to summarise it or give food for thought. Like this: -->

<!-- ```{block, type='infobox'} -->
<!-- A horse walks into a bar and orders a pint. The barkeep says "you're in here pretty often. Think you might be an alcoholic?", to which the horse says "I don't think I am.", and vanishes from existence. -->

<!-- See, the joke is about Descartes' famous philosophy of 'I think therefore, I am", but to explain that part before the rest of the joke would be to put Descartes before the horse. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We can have boxes with different icons for different purposes, using `{block, type='see styles.css'}`: -->

<!-- ```{block, type='questions'} -->
<!-- This might be useful for excercises or general questions. Do you like it? -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{block, type='beware'} -->
<!-- Sometimes there are things that are really important, like exceptions to general rules. This box might be appropriate for these. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- To use markdown/latex inside the boxes, use `{block2, ...}`: -->

<!-- ```{block2, type='research'} -->
<!-- ["More research needs to be done"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Further_research_is_needed) as an infobox. -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- And to use entire code blocks _within_ such boxes, we need to make use of raw html (like `<div class="beware">`): -->

<!-- <div class="beware"> -->
<!-- This is just a test. -->

<!-- ```{r, testbox} -->
<!-- # a roll of 5d6 might look like this: -->
<!-- sample(1:6, 5, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Hear, hear! It's 2:30 PM and all is good! -->

<!-- </div> -->


<!-- ### Plots -->

<!-- This is a plot of quite a famous dataset [@anscombe1973]: -->

<!-- ```{r ch-preface-a_plot_example_01, fig.cap="Anscombe's Quartet: four different data sets all of which receive the same correlation score."} -->
<!-- tibble( -->
<!--   grp = rep(c("I", "II", "III", "IV"), each = 11), -->
<!--   x = c(anscombe$x1, anscombe$x2, anscombe$x3, anscombe$x4), -->
<!--   y = c(anscombe$y1, anscombe$y2, anscombe$y3, anscombe$y4) -->
<!-- ) %>%  -->
<!--   ggplot(aes(x, y)) + -->
<!--     geom_smooth(method = lm, se = F, color = "black") + -->
<!--     geom_point(color = project_colors[3], size = 2) + -->
<!--     scale_y_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) + -->
<!--     scale_x_continuous(breaks = scales::pretty_breaks()) + -->
<!--     labs(title = "Anscombe's Quartet", x = NULL, y = NULL, -->
<!--          subtitle = bquote(y == 0.5 * x + 3 ~ (R^2 %~~% .667) ~ "for all datasets")) + -->
<!--     facet_wrap(~grp, ncol = 2, scales = "free_x") + -->
<!--     theme(strip.background = element_rect(fill = "#f2f2f2", colour = "white")) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Here's a plot showcasing our custom palellet for discrete factors: -->

<!-- ```{r ch-preface-Setosa, fig.cap="A figure to test the contrast of the first three project colors"} -->
<!-- ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) + geom_point(size=3) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ### Shiny Apps -->

<!-- Embedding Shiny Apps is as easy as pie! -->

<!-- ```{r shiny_example} -->
<!-- knitr::include_app("https://marauderpixie.shinyapps.io/dist_chisq/", height = "800px") -->
<!-- ``` -->
