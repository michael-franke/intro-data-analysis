# "chapter" folder in github

* ~~Add bibliography-folder because Rmd-chapter (04-models) refer to .bib file (don't know how to organize references else)~~

# General remarks
* Usage of **Latex math notation** in Rmd-files (e.g. 04-models) -- may cause problems when converting to .md/.pdf/.html
* I currently fail to incorporate the **Latex**-selfmade-package for the **graphical model notation**
