# Introduction into the Example

## Two variants of a moral dilemma story

**The Trolley Problem**

You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the main track. You are standing next to a lever that controls a switch. If you pull the lever, the trolley will be redirected onto a side track, and the five people on the main track will be saved. However, there is a single person lying on the side track.

*Do you pull the lever?*

* Yes
* No


**The Fat Man Problem**

You see a runaway trolley moving toward five tied-up (or otherwise incapacitated) people lying on the main track. You are on a bridge under which it will pass, and you can stop it by putting something very heavy in front of it. As it happens, there is a very fat man next to you - your only way to stop the trolley is to push him over the bridge and onto the track, killing him to save five. 

*Do you push the man?*

* Yes
* No

# The Data

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(brms)
library(ggsignif)
```


```{r}
###Using dummy data as placeholder
#load data set and inspect it

data <- MASS::survey
head(data)
```

```{r}
# Transform factor "sex" into 1-0 variable and omit cases with NA
data3 <- tibble(handedness = data$W.Hnd,
                sex = recode(data$Sex, "Female"=1, "Male"=0)) %>% 
  na.omit()
data3
```

```{r}
# rearrange data set for Bayesian parameter estimation
data4 <- group_by(data3, handedness, sex) %>% 
  summarise(trials=n())
data4
```

# Building the model

## The data --- What do we observe?
The two dilemma were answered by N participants. The \emph{variable} "answer" has a dichotmous \emph{outcome} "1" and "0", where "1" indicates \emph{action} and "0" indicates \emph{no action}. In order to see how the group of participants answered on average per dilemma we can summarize the data.
For example we can calculate the \emph{number of "action" answers} and the \emph{number of "no action" answers} per dilemma.

```{r}
#select relevant variables and show them as table()
data2 <- tibble(Sex = data$Sex, 
                Handedness = data$W.Hnd) %>% 
  table()
data2
```

As we know the number of participants ($N$) it is sufficent to look, per dilemma, at the number of "yes" answers(=action), in the following referred to as $k$. The number of "no"(=no action) answers can be derived automatically from that ($N-k$). 

In the next step we want to define a \emph{descriptive model of the data} that is meaningful for our research question. That is, we are interested in identifying if the probability for "action" ("yes") differentiates between the two "dilemma"-groups (Trolley vs. FatMan).

## Identifying relevant variables
We assume that for each group (dilemma) exists an underlying \emph{probability} variable that \emph{influences} the number of observed outcomes. We will call these variables $\theta_1$ (for the Trolley-dilemma) and $\theta_2$ (for the FatMan-dilemma). 

```{r}
#Plot to illustrate conceptional background
dummydata <- data.frame(x = c("theta1", "theta2"),
                        y = c(0.4, 0.7))

ggplot(data = dummydata, mapping = aes(x=x, y=y)) +
  geom_col() +
  ylim(0,1) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("theta1" = expression(theta[1]),
                              "theta2" = expression(theta[2]))) +
  labs(title = "Two groups (dichotomous data)",
       y = "Proportion for *Action* (X=k)", x = "Dilemmas")
```

## Describing the random variation
Similar to the modell for "one group" we can consider the following conditions modified for the "two group"-case:

* a dependent variable with a dichotmous outcome (1 and 0), and
* a constant probability for each dilemma, thus, $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$,

the distribution family with maximum entropy is the \emph{Bernoulli or Binomial distribution}. 

## Priors --- Considerations about prior knowledge 
Following the Bayesian idea we have to incorporate prior knowledge. Similar to the "one group"-model we are \emph{ignorant} about the outcome of both groups. Thus, for $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ the *Beta(1,1)*-prior is used.

# Notation of the model
Sofar, we have make considerations about 

* the dependet variable and the observed outcome $k$, 
* the assumed underlying probability for each dilemma $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, 
* the appropriate distribution family which describes best the random variation of outcomes for each group ($Binomial(\theta_1)$ and $Binomial(\theta_2)$) and 
* a distribution which describes our prior belief for each $\theta$ ($Beta(1,1)$).

## Graphical notation
The graphical notation of the current model is:
![alt text](https://github.com/michael-franke/intro-data-analysis/tree/master/notes/Examples-complete/ChiSquareTest-Dilemma/Binom_two_groups.png "Beta Binomial model - two groups")

## Textual notation 
The textual notation of the current model from a Frequentist perspective (without prior):
$$k \sim Binomial(\theta_j),$$

$$\textrm{with } j = \begin{cases}
dilemma_1,\\
dilemma_2,
\end{cases}$$

and from a Bayesian perspective (with prior)

$$k \sim Binomial(\theta_j),$$
$$\textrm{with } j = \begin{cases}
dilemma_1,\\
dilemma_2,
\end{cases}$$
and
$$\theta_j \sim Beta(1,1).$$
# Modelling revisited(1)

## Underlying parameters & link function
Again we assume one parameter $\beta_0$ for each dilemma in order to estimate the respective $\theta$.
As already discussed in the "one-group"-model example we need to consider a \emph{link function} that links the estimated parameter appropriately to the respective expected value $\theta$. This link function is the \emph{logit} link or, when using the inversed link, the \emph{logistic} link function.

```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#Simulation of two logistic link functions 
x <- seq(from = -4, to = 4, length.out = 100)
y.log1 <- logistic(x)       #logistic relationship for group 1
y.log2 <- logistic(2*x)   #logistic relationship for group 2

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))   #set both plot beside each other
plot(x,y.log1,type="l", ylab=expression(theta[1]), xlab=expression(logistic~(beta[01])))
rect(-5,0,5,1,col = rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5,1/4), border = NA)
plot(x,y.log2,type="l", ylab=expression(theta[2]), xlab=expression(logistic~(beta[02])))
rect(-5,0,5,1,col = rgb(0.5,0.5,0.5,1/4), border = NA)
```

## Notation of the model (revisited) - Two groups (1)
The current descriptive model incorporates the idea that we estimate a parameter $\beta_0$ that defines the expected value $\theta$. The parameter is transformed by a logistic link, so it maps to $\theta$. The expected value $\theta$ is assumed to influence the observed number of "true" answers. While the variation of the outcome is assumed to follow a Bernoulli distribution.

The Frequentist model is:
$$\theta_j = logistic(\beta_{0j}),$$
$$\textrm{with } j = \begin{cases}
dilemma_1,\\
dilemma_2,
\end{cases}$$

$$k \sim Binomial(\theta_j).$$

The model from a Bayesian perspective (with prior) is:

$$\theta_j = logistic(\beta_{0j}),$$
$$\textrm{with } j = \begin{cases}
dilemma_1,\\
dilemma_2,
\end{cases}$$

$$k \sim Binomial(\theta_j),$$
$$\theta_j \sim Beta(1,1).$$

## Notation of the model (revisited) - Factorial design (2)
A different perspective on looking at the difference between two groups would be to estimate indeed the \emph{difference} between them. That is
$$\theta_2 - \theta_1.$$
If this value is near zero than we would assume that the answer for "action" or "no action" does not differ between both dilemmas. The question arises how the model can be reparameterized such that we can estimate the \emph{difference}. It turns out that we can use the same parameterization as we would use for linear regression:

$$\theta_j=\beta_0+\beta_1*X_{Dilemma},$$
$$\textrm{with } X_{Dilemma}=\begin{cases}
0, \textrm{if Dilemma 1 (Trolley),}\\
1, \textrm{if Dilemma 2 (FatMan).}
\end{cases}$$

Considering the Trolley-Dilemma the above equation would result in
$$\theta_1 = \beta_0,$$
which is the \emph{intercept} and indicates the proportion of "action" answers for the Trolley-dilemma.
Considering by contrast the FatMan-dilemma would result in the following equation:
$$\theta_2 = \beta_0 + \beta_1.$$
The proportion of "action" answers for the FatMan-dilemma has to be calcuated by summing up the \emph{intercept} $\beta_0$ and the \emph{slope} $\beta_1$.

Taken togehter: *What is the interpretation of the slope $\beta_1$?*
The difference of $theta_2-\theta2$ is
$$\theta_2 - \theta_1 = (\beta_0+\beta_1)-\beta_0=\beta_1,$$
exactly the slope $\beta_1$, thus, we can see that indeed this reparameterization enables us to estimate the difference between the groups.
