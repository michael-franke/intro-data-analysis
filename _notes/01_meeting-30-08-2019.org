* course structure

** general introduction

- what stats is about
- different practices
- learning goals

** data

- different kinds of data
- summary statistics
- data wrangling
- data plotting

*** learning goal:

- how to arrange, summarize and visualize (aspects of data) to address a question of interest ("hypothesis-driven data poking")

** probability

- probability distributions
- random variables
- conditional probability
- selected distributions (see webbook, shiny apps)

*** learning goal:

- get comfortable with basic notions of probability theory

** models

- priors & likelihood
- conceptual differences between frequentist and Bayesian approaches (revisited)
- notation (probabilistic causal networks)
- three example models:
  - "binomial model"
  - "factorial-design model"
  - simple linear regression model

*** learning goal:

- diagnosing the (conceptual) differences between kinds of statistical models

** inference

- MLE vs posterior
- confidence intervals
- credible intervals
- briefly: algorithms for MLE & Bayesian inference

** hypothesis testing

- binomial test 
- t-test
- ANOVA
- linear regression

** model comparison

- AIC
- likelihood ratio test
- Bayes factor

** generalized regression modeling

- applications
