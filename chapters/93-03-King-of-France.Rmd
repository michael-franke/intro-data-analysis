A **presupposition** of a sentence is a piece of information that is necessary for the sentence to make sense, but which is not communicated explicitly. If I say "Jones chained my camel to a tree", this sentence presupposes, somewhat incredibly, that I own a camel. If it is false that I own a camel, the sentence makes no sense. Yet, if I say it and you say: "I disagree", you take issue with my claim about chaining, not about me owning a camel. In this sense, the presupposition is not part of the explicitly contributed content (it is "not at issue content", as the linguists would say). 

We here partially replicate a previous study by @AbrusanSzendroi2013:Experimenting-w investigating how sentences with false presuppositions are perceived. The main question of interest for us is whether sentences with a false presupposition are rather regarded as true or rather as false. We therefore present participants with sentences (see below) and have them rate these as 'true' or 'false', a so-called **truth-value judgement task**, a common paradigm in experimental semantics and pragmatics. (The original study by @AbrusanSzendroi2013:Experimenting-w also included a third option 'cannot tell', which we do not use since this data set is mainly used for toying around with binary choice data.)

@AbrusanSzendroi2013:Experimenting-w presented their participants with 11 different types of sentences, of which we here only focus on five. Here are examples of the five conditions we test, using the corresponding condition numbers from the experiment by @AbrusanSzendroi2013:Experimenting-w. 

**C0.** The king of France is bald.

**C1.** France has a king, and he is bald.

**C6.** The King of France isn’t bald.

**C9.** The King of France, he did not call Emmanuel Macron last night.

**C10.** Emmanuel Macron, he did not call the King of France last night.

The presupposition in question is "France has a king". C0 and C1 differ only with respect to whether this piece of information is presupposed (C0) or explicitly asserted (C1). The variants C0 and C6 differ only with respect to negation in the main (asserted) proposition. Finally, the contrast pair C9 and C10 is interesting because of a particular topic-focus structure and the placement of negation. In C9, the topic is "the King of France", which introduces the presupposition in question. In C10, the topic is "Emmanuel Macron", but it introduces the presupposition under a negation.

#### The experiment

##### Participants

We obtained data from 97 participants via the online crowd-sourcing platform [Prolific](https://prolific.co).^[We recruited 100 participants, but the data from three participants was not recorded due to technical problems.] All participants were native speakers of English.

##### Material

The sentence material consisted of five vignettes. Here are the sentences that constitute "condition 1" of each of the five vignettes:

**V1.** The King of France is bald.

**V2.** The Emperor of Canada is fond of sushi.

**V3.** The Pope’s wife is a lawyer.

**V4.** The Belgian rainforest provides a habitat for many species.

**V5.** The volcanoes of Germany dominate the landscape.

As every vignette occurred in each of the five conditions, there are a total of 25 critical sentences. Additionally, for each vignette, there is a "background check" sentence, which is intended to find out whether participants know whether the relevant presuppositions are true. The "background check" sentences are:

**BC1.** France has a king.

**BC2.** The Pope is currently not married.

**BC3.** Canada is a democracy.

**BC4.** Belgium has rainforests.

**BC5.** Germany has volcanoes.

Finally, there are also 110 filler sentences, which do not have a presupposition, but also require common world knowledge for a correct answer. As each filler has an uncontroversially correct answer, these fillers also serve as a general attention check to probe into whether participants are reading the sentences carefully enough. Example filler sentences are:

**F1.** William Shakespeare was a famous Italian painter in Rome.

**F2.** There were two world wars in the 20th century.

##### Procedure

Each experimental run started with five practice trials, which used the five additional sentences, which were like the filler material and the same for each participant, presented in random order.

The main part of the experiment presented each participant with five critical sentences, exactly one from each vignette and exactly one from each condition, allocated completely at random. Each participant also saw all of the five "background check" sentences. Each "background check" sentence was presented *after* the corresponding vignette's critical sentence. All of these test trials were interspersed with 14 random filler sentences.

##### Realization

The experiment was realized using [_magpie](https://magpie-ea.github.io/magpie-site/index.html) and can be tried out [here](https://magpie-king-of-france.netlify.com).

#### Hypotheses

We will be interested in the following research questions:

- **H1**: The latent probability of "TRUE" judgements is higher in C0 (with presupposition) than in C1 (where the presupposition is part of the at-issue / asserted content).
- **H2**: There is no difference in truth-value judgements between C0 (the positive sentence) and C6 (the negative sentence).
- **H3**: The disposition towards "TRUE" judgements is lower for C9 (where the presupposition is topical) than for C10 (where the presupposition is not topical and occurs under negation).

### Loading and preprocessing the data

First, load the data:

```{r}
data_KoF_raw <- aida::data_KoF_raw
```

And then have a glimpse:

```{r}
glimpse(data_KoF_raw)
```


The most important variables in this data set are:

- `submission_id`: unique identifier for each participant
- `trial_type`: whether the trial was of the category `filler`, `main`, `practice` or `special`, where the latter encodes the "background checks"
- `item_version`: the condition to which the test sentence belongs (only given for trials of type `main` and `special`)
- `response`: the answer ("TRUE" or "FALSE") on each trial
- `vignette`: the current item's vignette number (applies only to trials of type `main` and `special`)

As the variable names used in the raw data are not ideal, we will pre-process the raw data a bit for easier analysis.

```{r}
data_KoF_processed <- data_KoF_raw %>% 
  # discard practice trials
  filter(trial_type != "practice") %>% 
  mutate(
    # add a 'condition' variable
    condition = case_when(
      trial_type == "special" ~ "background check",
      trial_type == "main" ~ str_c("Condition ", item_version),
      TRUE ~ "filler"
    ) %>% 
      factor( 
        ordered = T,
        levels = c(str_c("Condition ", c(0, 1, 6, 9, 10)), "background check", "filler")
      )
  )
```


### Cleaning the data

We clean the data in two consecutive steps:

1. Remove all data from any participant who got more than 50% of the answer to filler material wrong.
2. Remove individual main trials if the corresponding "background check" question was answered wrongly.

#### Cleaning by-participant

```{r}
# look at error rates for filler sentences by subject
# mark every subject with < 0.5 proportion correct

subject_error_rate <- data_KoF_processed %>% 
  filter(trial_type == "filler") %>% 
  group_by(submission_id) %>% 
  summarise(
    proportion_correct = mean(correct_answer == response),
    outlier_subject = proportion_correct < 0.5
  ) %>% 
  arrange(proportion_correct)
```

Plot the results:

```{r}
# plot by-subject error rates
subject_error_rate %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = proportion_correct, color = outlier_subject, shape = outlier_subject)) + 
  geom_jitter(aes(y = ""), width = 0.001) +
  xlab("Poportion of correct answers") + ylab("") + 
  ggtitle("Distribution of proportion of correct answers on filler trials") +
  xlim(0, 1) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Outlier") +
  scale_shape_discrete(name = "Outlier")
```

Apply the cleaning step:

```{r}
# add info about error rates and exclude outlier subject(s)
d_cleaned <- 
  full_join(data_KoF_processed, subject_error_rate, by = "submission_id") %>% 
  filter(outlier_subject == FALSE)

```


#### Cleaning by-trial


```{r}
# exclude every critical trial whose 'background' test question was answered wrongly

d_cleaned <- 
  d_cleaned %>% 
  # select only the 'background question' trials
  filter(trial_type == "special") %>% 
  # is the background question answered correctly?
  mutate(
    background_correct = correct_answer == response
  ) %>%
  # select only the relevant columns
  select(submission_id, vignette, background_correct) %>%
  # right join lines to original data set 
  right_join(d_cleaned, by = c("submission_id", "vignette")) %>% 
  # remove all special trials, as well as main trials with incorrect background check
  filter(trial_type == "main" & background_correct == TRUE)

```


### Exploration: summary stats & plots

Plot for ratings by condition:

```{r}
d_cleaned %>% 
  # drop unused factor levels
  droplevels() %>% 
  # get means and 95% bootstrapped CIs for each condition
  group_by(condition) %>%
  nest() %>% 
  summarise(
    CIs = map(data, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$response == "TRUE"))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(CIs) %>% 
  # plot means and CIs
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = mean, fill = condition)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, width = 0.2)) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  ylab("") + xlab("") + ggtitle("Proportion of 'TRUE' responses per condition") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = project_colors)
```

Plot for each condition & vignette:

```{r}
data_KoF_processed %>% 
  filter(trial_type == "main") %>%
  droplevels() %>% 
  group_by(condition, vignette) %>% 
  nest() %>% 
  summarise(
    CIs = map(data, function(d) bootstrapped_CI(d$response == "TRUE"))
  ) %>% 
  unnest(CIs) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = condition, y = mean, fill = vignette)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge2") +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper),
    width = 0.3,
    position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)
  ) +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  ylab("") + xlab("") + ggtitle("Proportion of 'TRUE' responses per condition & vignette")
```
