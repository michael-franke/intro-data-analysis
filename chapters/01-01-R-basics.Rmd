R is a specialized programming language for data science. Though old, it is heavily supported by an active community. New tools for data handling, visualization, and statistical analysis are provided in the form of **packages**.^[Packages live in the official package repository [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/), or are supplied in less standardized forms, e.g., via open repositories, such as GitHub.] While other programming languages, like Python or Julia, specialized for scientific computing, also lend themselves beautifully for data analysis, the choice of R in this book is motivated because R's _raison d'être_ is data analysis. Also, some of the R packages  used in this book provide cutting-edge methods that are not as conveniently available in other programming languages (yet).  

In a manner of speaking, there are two flavors of R. We should distinguish **base R** from the **tidyverse**. Base R is what you have when you do not load any packages. We enter the _tidyverse_ by loading the package `tidyverse` (see below for information on how to do that). The tidyverse consists of several components (which are actually stand-alone packages that can be loaded separately if needed) all of which supply extra functionality for data analysis, based on a unifying philosophy and representation format. While eventually interchangeable, the look-and-feel of base R and the tidyverse is quite different. Figure \@ref(fig:01-00-tidyverse-overview) lists a selection of packages from the tidyverse in relation to their role at different stages of the process of data analysis. 

```{r 01-00-tidyverse-overview, echo = F, fig.cap="Overview of selected packages from the tidyverse. The image is taken from [this introduction to the tidyverse](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/06/08/what-is-the-tidyverse/)."}

```

<!-- The course will also introduce [Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/articles_intro.html) in Section \@ref(ch-01-01-Rmarkdown). Rmarkdown is a nice way of documenting your data analysis in a reproducible form. Participants will use Rmarkdown to prepare their homework assignments. -->

The official documentation for base R is ["An Introduction to R"](https://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/). The standard reference for using the tidyverse is ["R for Data Science (R4DS)"](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). There are some very useful [cheat sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) which you should definitely check out! There are pointers to further material in Appendix \@ref(app-90-further-material).

```


## First steps {#ch1-first-steps}

R is an interpreted language. This means that you do not have to compile it. You can just evaluate it line by line, in a so-called **session**. The session stores the current values of all variables. Usually, code is stored  in a **script**, so one does not have to retype it when starting a new session. ^[Line-by-line execution of code is useful for quick development and debugging. Make sure to learn about keyboard shortcuts to execute single lines or chunks of code in your favorite editor, e.g., check the [RStudio Cheat Sheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) for information on its keyboard shortcuts.]

Try this out by either typing `r` to open an R session in a terminal or load RStudio.^[When starting a session in a terminal, you can exit a running R session by typing `quit()` or `q()`.] You can immediately calculate stuff:

```{r}
6 * 7
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.1**
Use R to calculate 5 times the result of 659 minus 34.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r}
5 * (659 - 34)
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Functions

R has many built-in functions. The most common situation is that the function is called by its name using **prefix notation**, followed by round brackets that enclose the function's arguments (separated by commata if there are multiple arguments). For example, the function `round` takes a number and, per default, returns the closest integer:

```{r}
# the function `round` takes a number as an argument and 
# returns the closest integer (default)
round(0.6)
```

Actually, `round` allows several arguments. It takes as input the number `x` to be rounded and another integer number `digits` which gives the number of digits after the comma to which `x` should be rounded. We can then specify these arguments in a function call of `round` by providing the named arguments.

```{r}
# rounds the number `x` to the number `digits` of digits
round(x = 0.138, digits = 2)
```

If all of the parsed arguments are named, then their order does not matter. But all non-named arguments have to be presented in the positions expected by the function after subtracting the named arguments from the ordered list of arguments (to find out the right order one should use `help`, as explained below in \@ref(Chap-01-01-R-help)). Here are examples for illustration:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
round(x = 0.138, digits = 2)  # works as intended
round(digits = 2, x = 0.138)  # works as intended
round(0.138, digits = 2)      # works as intended
round(0.138, 2)               # works as intended
round(x = 0.138, 2)           # works as intended
round(digits = 2, 0.138)      # works as intended
round(2, x = 0.138)           # works as intended
round(2, 0.138)               # does not work as intended (returns 2)
```

Functions can have default values for some or for all of their arguments. In the case of `round`, the default is `digits = 0`. There is obviously no default for `x` in the function `round`.
```{r}
round(x = 6.138) # returns 6
```

Some functions can take an arbitrary number of arguments. The function `sum`, which sums up numbers is a point in case.

```{r}
# adds all of its arguments together
sum(1, 2, 3)
```

Selected functions can also be called in **infix notation**. This applies to frequently recurring operations, such as mathematical operations or logical comparisons.

```{r, eval = F}
# both of these calls sum 1, 2, and 3 together
sum(1, 2, 3)     # prefix notation
1 + 2 + 3      # prefix notation
```

Section \@ref(Chap-01-01-functions) will list some of the most important built-in functions. It will also explain how to define your own functions.

### Variables

You can assign values to variables using three assignment operators: `->`, `<-` and `=`, like so:

```{r}
x <- 6       # assigns 6 to variable x
7 -> y       # assigns 7 to variable y
z = 3        # assigns 3 to variable z
x * y / z    # returns 6 * 7 / 3 = 14
```

Use of `=` is discouraged.^[You can produce `<-` in RStudio with Option-`-` (on Mac) and Alt-`-` (on Windows/Linux). For other useful keyboard shortcuts, see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts).]

It is good practice to use a consistent naming scheme for variables. This book uses `snake_case_variable_names` and tends towards using `long_and_excessively_informative_names` for important variables, and short variable names, like `i`, `j` or `x`, for local variables, indices etc.

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.2**

Create two variables, `a` and `b`, and assign the values 103 and 14 to them, respectively. Next, divide variable `a` by variable `b` and produce an output with three digits after the comma.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r }
a <- 103
b <- 14
round(x = a/b, digits = 3)
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Literate coding

It is good practice to document code with short but informative comments. Comments in R are demarcated with `#`.

```{r}
x <- 4711 # a nice number from Cologne
```

Since everything on a line after an occurrence of `#` is treated as a comment, it is possible to break long function calls across several lines, and to add comments to each line:

```{r, eval = F}
round(            # call the function `round`
  x = 0.138,      # number to be rounded
  digits = 2      # number of after-comma digits to round to
)  
```

In RStudio, you can use `Command+Shift+C` (on Mac) and `Ctrl+Shift+C` (on Windows/Linux) to comment or uncomment code, and you can use comments to structure your scripts. Any comment followed by `----` is treated as a (foldable) section in RStudio.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# SECTION: variable assignments ----
x <- 6
y <- 7
# SECTION: some calculations ----
x * y
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.3**

Provide extensive comments to all operations in the solution code of the previous exercise. 

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r }
a <- 103   # assign value 103 to variable `a`
b <- 14    # assign value 14 to variable `b`
round(     # produce a rounded number
  x = a/b,     # number to be rounded is a/b
  digits = 3   # show three digits after the comma
)
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

### Objects

Strictly speaking, all entities in R are *objects* but that is not always apparent or important for everyday practical purposes ([see the manual for more information](https://colinfay.me/intro-to-r/objects-their-modes-and-attributes.html)). R supports an object-oriented programming style, but we will not make (explicit) use of this functionality. In fact, this book heavily uses and encourages a functional programming style (see Section \@ref(ch-01-01-loops-and-maps)).

However, some functions (e.g., optimizers or fitting functions for statistical models) return objects, and we will use this output in various ways. For example, if we run some model on a data set the output is an object. Here, for example, we run a regression model, that will be discussed later on in the book, on a dataset called `cars`. 

```{r}
# you do not need to understand this code
model_fit = lm(formula = speed~dist, data = cars)
# just notice that the function `lm` returns an object
is.object(model_fit)
# printing an object on the screen usually gives you summary information
print(model_fit)
```

### Packages

Much of R's charm unfolds through the use of packages. [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) has the official package repository. To install a new package from a CRAN mirror use the `install.packages` function. For example, to install the package `remotes`, you would use:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
```

Once installed, you need to load your desired packages for each fresh session, using a command like the following:^[You need to make sure that _all_ packages you need for a session are loaded, so you would need to supply several commands like `library(PCKG_NAME)` for all required packages.]

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(remotes)
```

Once loaded, all functions, data, etc. that ship with a package are available without additional reference to the package name. If you want to be careful or courteous to an admirer of your code, you can reference a function from a package also by explicitly referring to that package. For example, the following code calls the function `install_github` from the package `remotes` explicitly.^[Calling functions in this explicit way also dispenses the need to load the package first (though you need to have installed it before), and it might help with naming conflicts, when different packages define identically named functions.]

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("SOME-URL")
```

Indeed, the `install_github` function allows you to install bleeding-edge packages from Github. You can install all packages relevant for this book using the following code (after installing the `remotes` package):

```{r, eval = F}
remotes::install_github("michael-franke/aida-package")
```

After this installation, you can load all packages for this book simply by using:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(aida)
```

In RStudio, there is a special tab in the pane with information on "files", "plots" etc. to show all installed packages. This also shows which packages are currently loaded.


### Getting help {#Chap-01-01-R-help}

If you encounter a function like `lm` that you do not know about, you can access its documentation with the `help` function or just typing `?lm`. For example, the following call summons the documentation for `lm`, the first parts of which are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:R-doc-example).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
help(lm)
```

```{r R-doc-example, echo = F, fig.cap = "Excerpt from the documentation of the `lm` function."}
knitr::include_graphics("visuals/R-doc-example.png")
```

If you are looking for help on a more general topic, use the function `help.search`. It takes a regular expression as input and outputs a list of occurrences in the available documentation. A useful shortcut for `help.search` is just to type `??` followed by the (unquoted) string to search for. For example, calling either of the following lines might produce a display like in Figure \@ref(fig:R-doc-search-example).

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# two equivalent ways for obtaining help on search term 'linear'
help.search("linear")
??linear
```


```{r R-doc-search-example, fig.cap = "Result of calling `help.search` for the term 'linear'."}
knitr::include_graphics("visuals/R-doc-search-example.png")
```

The top entries in Figure \@ref(fig:R-doc-search-example) are **vignettes**. These are compact manuals or tutorials on particular topics or functions, and they are directly available in R. If you want to browse through the vignettes available on your machine (which depend on which packages you have installed), go ahead with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
browseVignettes()
```
<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.4**

Look up the help page for the command `round`. As you know about this function already, focus on getting a feeling for how the help text is structured and the most important bits of information are conveyed. Try to understand what the other functions covered in this entry do and when which one would be most useful.

## Data types {#ch1-data-types}

To learn about a new programming language entails to first learn something about what kinds of objects (elements, first-order citizens) you will have to deal with.
Let's therefore briefly go through the data types that are most important for our later purposes.
We will see how to deal with numeric information, Booleans, strings and so forth.
In general, we can assess the type of an object stored in variable `x` with the function `typeof(x)`. 
Let's just try this for a bunch of things, just to give you an overview of some of R's data types (not all of which are important to know about right from the start):

```{r, eval = F}
typeof(3)        # returns type "double"
typeof(TRUE)     # returns type "logical"
typeof(cars)     # returns 'list' (includes data.frames, tibbles, objects, ...)
typeof("huhu")   # return 'character" (= string) 
typeof(mean)     # return 'closure" (= function)
typeof(c)        # return 'builtin" (= deep system internal stuff)
typeof(round)    # returns type "special" (= well, special stuff?)
```

If you really wonder, you can sometimes learn more about an object, if you just print it out as a string:

```{r}
# `lm` is actually a function ("linear model")
# the function `str` casts this function into a string
# the result is then printed to screen
str(lm)
```

It is sometimes possible to cast objects of one type into another type `XXX` using functions `as.XXX` in base R or `as_XXX` in the tidyverse.

```{r}
# casting Boolean value `TRUE` into number format 
as.numeric(TRUE)  # returns 1
```

Casting can also happen explicitly. The expressions `TRUE` and `FALSE` are built-in variables for the Boolean values "true" and "false". But when we use them in mathematical expressions, we can do math with them, like so:

```{r }
TRUE + TRUE + FALSE + TRUE + TRUE
```

### Numeric vectors & matrices

R is essentially an array-based language. Arrays are arbitrary but finite-dimensional matrices. We will discuss what is usually referred to as vectors (= one-dimensional arrays), matrices (= two-dimensional arrays), and arrays (= more-than-two-dimensional) in this section with a focus on numeric information. But it is important to keep in mind that arrays can contain objects of other types than numeric information (as long as all objects in the array are of the same type).


#### Numeric information

Standard number format in R is double. 

```{r}
typeof(3)
```

We can also represent numbers as integers and complex.

```{r}
typeof(as.integer(3))    # returns 'integer'
typeof(as.complex(3))    # returns 'complex'
```

#### Numeric vectors

As a generally useful heuristic, expect every numerical information to be treated as a vector (or higher-order: matrix, array, ... ; see below), and to expect any (basic, mathematical) operation in R to (most likely) apply to the whole vector, matrix, array, collection.^[If you are familiar with Python's *scipy* and *numpy* packages, this is R's default mode of treating numerical information.] This makes it possible to ask for the length of a variable to which we assign a single number, for instance:

```{r}
x <- 7
length(x)
```

We can even index such a variable:

```{r}
x <- 7
x[1]     # what is the entry in position 1 of the vector x?
```

Or assign a new value to a hitherto unused index:

```{r}
x[3] <- 6   # assign the value 6 to the 3rd entry of vector x
x           # notice that the 2nd entry is undefined, or "NA", not available
```

Vectors in general can be declared with the built-in function `c()`. To memorize this, think of *concatenation* or *combination*.

```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 1, 1)   # this is now a 4-place vector
x
```

There are also helpful functions to generate sequences of numbers:

```{r, eval = F}
1:10                                     # returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 1)           # returns 1, 2, 3, ..., 10
seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 0.5)         # returns 1, 1.5, 2, ..., 9.5, 10
seq(from = 0, to = 1 , length.out = 11)  # returns 0, 0.1, ..., 0.9, 1
```

Indexing in R starts with 1, not 0!

```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 1, 1)   # this is now a 4-place vector
x[2]
```

And now we see what is meant above when we said that (almost) every mathematical operation can be expected to apply to a vector:

```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 1, 1)   # 4-placed vector as before
x + 1
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.5**

Create a vector that contains all even numbers from 0 to 20 and assign it to a variable. Now transform the variable such that it contains only odd numbers up to 20 using mathematical operation. Notice that the numbers above 20 should not be included! [**Hint**: use indexing.]

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}
a <- seq(from = 0, to = 20, by = 2) 
a <- a + 1
a <- a[1:10]
a
```
</div>
</div>
</div>

#### Numeric matrices

Matrices are declared with the function `matrix`. This function takes, for instance, a vector as an argument.

```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 1, 1)     # 4-placed vector as before
(m <- matrix(x))       # cast x into matrix format
```

Notice that the result is a matrix with a single column. This is important. R uses so-called *column-major mode*.^[Python, on the other hand, uses the reverse *row-major mode*.] This means that it will fill columns first. For example, a matrix with three columns based on a six-placed vector $1, 2, \dots, 6$ will be built by filling the first column from top to bottom, then the second column top to bottom, and so on.^[It is in this sense that the "first index moves fastest" in column-major mode, which is another frequently given explanation of column-major mode.]

```{r}
m <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3)
m
```

In line with a column-major mode, vectors are treated as column vectors in matrix operations:

```{r}
x = c(1, 0, 1)   # 3-place vector
m %*% x          # dot product with previous matrix 'm'
```

As usual, and independently of a column- or row-major mode, matrix indexing starts with the row index:

```{r}
m[1,]   # produces first row of matrix 'm'
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.6**

Create a sequence of 9 numbers, equally spaced, staring from 0 and ending with 1. Assign this sequence to a vector called `x`. Now, create a matrix, stored in variable `X`, with three columns and three rows that contain the numbers of this vector in the usual column-major fashion.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}
x <- seq(from = 0, to = 1, length.out = 9)
X <- matrix(x, ncol = 3)
X
```
</div>
</div>

We have not yet covered this, but give it a try and guess what might be a convenient and very short statement to compute the sum of all numbers in matrix `X`.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}
sum(X)
```
</div>
</div>

</div>

#### Arrays

Arrays are simply higher-dimensional matrices. We will not make (prominent) use of arrays in this book.

#### Names for vectors, matrices and arrays

The positions in a vector can be given names. This is extremely useful for good "literate coding" and therefore highly recommended. The names of vector `x`'s positions are retrieved and set by the `names` function:

```{r}
students <- c("Jax", "Jamie", "Jason")  # names of students
grades <- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0)              # a vector of grades
names(grades)                           # retrieve names: with no names so far
names(grades) <- students               # assign names
names(grades)                           # retrieve names again: names assigned
grades                                  # output shows names
```

We can also set the names of a vector directly during construction. A first, more explicit way of doing this is:^[Notice that we can create strings (actually called 'characters' in R) with double quotes.]

```{r}
# names of students (this is a character vector, see below)
students <- c("Jax", "Jamie", "Jason")  
# constructing a vector with names directly assigned
grades <- c(1.3, 2.7, 2.0, names = students) 
```

But we can also do this in one swoop, like so:

```{r }
c(Jax = 1.3, Jamie = 2.7, Jason = 2.0)
```

Names for matrices are retrieved or set with functions `rownames` and `colnames`.

```{r}
# declare matrix
m <- matrix(1:6, ncol = 3)  
# assign row and column names, using function
# `str_c` which is described below
rownames(m) <- str_c("row", 1:nrow(m), sep = "_")
colnames(m) <- str_c("col", 1:ncol(m), sep = "_")
m
```

### Booleans

There are built-in names for Boolean values "true" and "false", predictably named `TRUE` and `FALSE`. Equivalent shortcuts are `T` and `F`. If we attempt to do math with Boolean vectors, the outcome is what any reasonable logician would expect:

```{r}
x <- c(T, F, T)
1 - x
x + 3
```

Boolean vectors can be used as index sets to extract elements from other vectors.

```{r}
# vector 1, 2, ..., 5
number_vector  <- 1:5           
# index of odd numbers set to `TRUE`
boolean_vector <- c(T, F, T, F, T)  
# returns the elemnts from number vector, for which
# the corresponding element in the Boolean vector is true
number_vector[boolean_vector] 
```




### Special values

There are a couple of keywords reserved in R for special kinds of objects:

- `NA`: "not available"; represent missing values in data
- `NaN`: "not a number"; e.g., division zero by zero
- `Inf` or `-Inf`: infinity and negative infinity; returned when a number is too big or divided by zero
- `NULL`: the NULL object; often returned when a function is undefined for the provided input

### Characters (= strings)

Strings are called characters in R. We will be stubborn and call them strings for most of the time here. We can assign a string value to a variable by putting the string in double-quotes:

```{r}
x <- "huhu"
typeof(x)
```

We can create vectors of characters in the obvious way:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
chr_vector
```


The package `stringr` from the tidyverse also provides very useful and, in comparison to base R, more uniform functions for string manipulation. The [cheat sheet](http://edrub.in/CheatSheets/cheatSheetStringr.pdf) for the `stingr` package is highly recommended for a quick overview. Below are some examples.

Function `str_c` concatenates strings:

```{r}
str_c("Hello", "Hi", "Hey", sep = "! ")
```

We can find the indices of matches in a character vector with `str_which`:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
str_which(chr_vector, "hu")
```

Similarly, `str_detect` gives a Boolean vector of matching:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
str_detect(chr_vector, "hu")
```

If we want to get the strings matching a pattern, we can use `str_subset`:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
str_subset(chr_vector, "hu")
```

Replacing all matches with another string works with `str_replace_all`:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
str_replace_all(chr_vector, "h", "B")
```

For data preparation, we often need to split strings by a particular character. For instance, a set of reaction times could be separated by a character line "|". We can split this string representation to get individual measurements like so:

```{r}
# three measures of reaction time in a single string
reaction_times <- "123|234|345"
# notice that we need to doubly (!) escape character |
# notice also that the results is a list (see below)
str_split(reaction_times, "\\|", n = 3)
```

### Factors

Factors are special vectors, which treat its elements as instances of a finite set of categories. 
To create a factor, we can use the function `factor`. 
The following code creates a factor from a character vector.
Notice that, when printing, we get information of the kinds of entries (=categories) that occured in the original character vector:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
factor(chr_vector)
```

For plotting or other representational purposes, it can help to manually specify an ordering on the levels of a factor using the `levels` argument:

```{r}
# the order of levels is changed manually
factor(chr_vector, levels = c("huhu", "ciao", "hello"))
```

Even though we specified an ordering among factor levels, the last code chunk nonetheless creates what R treats as an *unordered factor*.
There are also genuine *ordered factors*.
An *ordered factor* is created by setting the argument `ordered = T`, and optionally also specifying a specific ordering of factor levels, like so: 

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
factor(
  chr_vector,    # the vector to treat as factor
  ordered = T,   # make sure it's treated as ordered factor
  levels = c("huhu", "ciao", "hello")  # specify order of levels by hand
)
```

Having both unordered and ordered factors is useful for representing data from experiments, e.g., from categorical or ordinal variables (see Chapter \@ref(Chap-02-01-data)).
The difference between an unordered factor with explicit ordering information and an ordered factor is subtle and not important in the beginning.
(This only matters, for example, in the context of regression modeling.)

Factors are trickier to work with than mere vectors because they are rigid about the represented factor levels. Adding an item that does not belong to any of a factor's levels, leads to trouble:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
my_factor <- factor(
  chr_vector,    # the vector to treat as factor
  ordered = T,   # make sure its treated as ordered factor
  levels = c("huhu", "ciao", "hello")  # specify order of levels
)
my_factor[5] <- "huhu"  # adding a "known category" is okay
my_factor[6] <- "moin"  # adding an "unknown category" does not work
my_factor
```

The `forcats` package from the tidyverse helps in dealing with factors. You should check the [Cheat Sheet](http://www.flutterbys.com.au/stats/downloads/slides/figure/factors.pdf) for more helpful functionality. Here is an example of how to expand the levels of a factor:

```{r}
chr_vector <- c("huhu", "hello", "huhu", "ciao")
my_factor <- factor(
  chr_vector,    # the vector to treat as factor
  ordered = T,   # make sure its treated as ordered factor
  levels = c("huhu", "ciao", "hello")  # specify order of levels
)
my_factor[5] <- "huhu"  # adding a "known category" is okay
my_factor <- fct_expand(my_factor, "moin") # add new category
my_factor[6] <- "moin"  # adding new item now works
my_factor
```

It is sometimes useful (especially for plotting) to flexibly reorder the levels of an ordered factor. Here are some useful functions from the `forcats` package:

```{r}
my_factor               # original factor
fct_rev(my_factor)      # reverse level order 
fct_relevel(            # manually supply new level order 
  my_factor,
  c("hello", "ciao", "huhu")
)      
```


### Lists, data frames & tibbles

Lists are key-value pairs. They are created with the built-in function `list`. The difference between a list and a named vector is that in the latter, all elements must be of the same type. In a list, the elements can be of arbitrary type. They can also be vectors or even lists themselves. For example:

```{r}
my_list <- list(
  single_number = 42,
  chr_vector    = c("huhu", "ciao"),
  nested_list   = list(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3) 
)
my_list
```

To access a list element by its name (= key), we can use the `$` sign followed by the unquoted name, double square brackets `[[ "name" ]]` with the quoted name inside, or indices in double brackets, like so:

```{r}
# all of these return the same list element
my_list$chr_vector
my_list[["chr_vector"]]
my_list[[2]]
```

Lists are very important in R because almost all structured data that belongs together is stored as lists. Objects are special kinds of lists. Data is stored in special kinds of lists, so-called *data frames* or so-called *tibbles*.

A data frame is base R's standard format to store data in. A data frame is a list of vectors of equal length. Data sets are instantiated with the function `data.frame`:

```{r}
# fake experimental data
exp_data <- data.frame(
  trial = 1:5,
  condition = factor(
    c("C1", "C2", "C1", "C3", "C2"),
    ordered = T
  ),
  response = c(121, 133, 119, 102, 156)
)
exp_data
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.7**

Create a vector `a` that contains the names of three of your best (imaginary) friends and a vector `b` with their (imaginary) age. Create a data frame that represents this information (one column with names and one with respective age). Notice that column names should represent the information they contain!

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r}
a <- c("M", "N", "H")
b <- c(23, 41, 13)
best_friends <- data.frame(name = a, age = b)
best_friends
```

</div>
</div>
</div>


We can access columns of a data frame, just like we access elements in a list. Additionally, we can also use index notation, like in a matrix:

```{r}
# gives the value of the cell in row 2, column 3
exp_data[2, 3] # returns 133
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.8**

Display the column of names of your (imaginary) friends from the `best_friends` data frame.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r}
best_friends["name"] 
best_friends[1] 
```
</div>
</div>

Now show only the names of friends who are younger than 22 (or some other age that makes sense for your friends and their ages). [**Hint:** you can write `x <= 22` to get a Boolean vector of the same length as `x` with an entry `TRUE` at all indices where `x` is no bigger than 22.]
 
<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}
best_friends[best_friends$age <= 22, "name"]
```
</div>
</div>
</div>

In RStudio, you can inspect data in data frames (and tibbles (see below)) with the function `View`.

*Tibbles* are the tidyverse counterpart of data frames. We can cast a data frame into a tibble, using `as_tibble`. Notice that the information shown for a tibble is much richer than what is provided when printing the content of a data frame.

```{r}
as_tibble(exp_data)
```

We can also create a tibble directly with the keyword `tibble`. Indeed, the creation of tibbles is conveniently more flexible than the creation of data frames: the former allows dynamic look-up of previously defined elements.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
my_tibble    <- tibble(x = 1:10, y = x^2)      # dynamic construction possible
my_dataframe <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = x^2)  # ERROR :/
```
Another important difference between data frames and tibbles concerns the default treatment of character (= string) vectors. When reading in data from a CSV file as a data frame (using function `read.csv`) each character vector is treated as a factor per default. But when using `read_csv` to read CSV data into a tibble character vector are not treated as factors. 

There is also a very convenient function, called `tribble`, which allows you to create a tibble by explicitly writing out the information in the rows.

```{r tribble-first-example}
hw_points <- tribble(
  ~hw_nr,       ~"Jax",   ~"Jamie",   ~"Jason",
  "HW1",        "33",     "24",       "17",
  "HW2",        "41",     "23",       "8"
)
hw_points

```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.9**

Assign to the variable `bff` a tibble with the following columns (with reasonable names): at least four names of your (imaginary) best friends, their current country of residence, their age, and a Boolean column storing whether they are not older than 23. Ideally, use dynamic construction and the `<=` operator as in previous exercises.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}
bff <- tibble(
  name = c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
  residence = c("UK", "JP", "CH", "JA"),
  age = c(24, 45, 72, 12),
  young = age <= 22
)
bff
```

## Functions {#Chap-01-01-functions}

### Some important built-in functions

Many helpful functions are defined in base R or supplied by packages. We recommend browsing the [Cheat Sheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) every now and then to pick up more useful stuff for your inventory. Here are some functions that are very basic and generally useful.

#### Standard logic

- `&`: "and"
- `|`: "or"
- `!`: "not"
- `negate()`: a pipe-friendly `!` (see Section \@ref(Chap-01-01-piping) for more on piping)
- `all()`: returns true of a vector if all elements are `T`
- `any()`: returns true of a vector if at least one element is `T`

#### Comparisons

- `<`: smaller
- `>`: greater
- `==`: equal (you can also use `near()`instead of `==` e.g. `near(3/3,1)`returns TRUE)
- `>=`: greater or equal
- `<=`: less or equal
- `!=`: not equal

#### Set theory

- `%in%`: whether an element is in a vector
- `union(x, y)`: union of `x` and `y`
- `intersect(x, y)`: intersection of `x` and `y`
- `setdiff(x, y)`: all elements in `x` that are not in `y`

#### Sampling and combinatorics

- `runif()`: random number from unit interval [0;1]
- `sample(x, size, replace)`: take `size` samples from `x` (with replacement if `replace` is `T`)
- `choose(n, k)`: number of subsets of size `n` out of a set of size `k` (binomial coefficient) 



### Defining your own functions

If you find yourself in a situation in which you would like to copy-paste some code, possibly with minor amendments, this usually means that you should wrap some recurring operations into a custom-defined function.
 
There are two ways of defining your own functions: as a named function, or an anonymous function.

#### Named functions

The special operator supplied by base R to create new functions is the keyword `function`. Here is an example of defining a new function with two input variables `x` and `y` that returns a computation based on these numbers. We assign a newly created function to the variable `cool_function` so that we can use this name to call the function later. Notice that the use of the `return` keyword is optional here. If it is left out, the evaluation of the last line is returned.

```{r, eval = F}
# define a new function
# takes two numbers x & y as argument
# return x * y + 1
cool_function <- function(x, y) {
  return(x * y + 1)   
}

# apply `cool_function` to some numbers:
cool_function(3, 3)     # return 10
cool_function(1, 1)     # return 2
cool_function(1:2, 1)   # returns vector [2,3]
cool_function(1)        # throws error: 'argument "y" is missing, with no default'
cool_function()         # throws error: 'argument "x" is missing, with no default'

```

We can give default values for the parameters passed to a function:

```{r, eval = F}
# same function as before but with
# default values for each argument
cool_function_2 <- function(x = 2, y = 3) {
  return(x * y + 1)
}

# apply `cool_function_2` to some numbers:
cool_function_2(3, 3)     # return 10
cool_function_2(1, 1)     # return 2
cool_function_2(1:2, 1)   # returns vector [2,3]
cool_function_2(1)        # returns 4 (= 1 * 3 + 1)
cool_function_2()         # returns 7 (= 2 * 3 + 1)
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.10**

Create a function, which takes two numbers and outputs 0 if their product is less than 100, and 1 otherwise. 

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

```{r}

bigger_100 <- function(x, y) {
 
  return(as.integer(x * y > 100))
}
```

</div>
</div>
</div>

#### Anonymous functions

Notice that we can feed functions as parameters to other functions. This is an important ingredient of a functional-style of programming, and something that we will rely on heavily in this book (see Section \@ref(ch-01-01-loops-and-maps)). When supplying a function as an argument to another function, we might not want to name the function that is passed. Here's a (stupid, but hopefully illustrating) example:

```{r, eval = F}
# define a function that takes a function as an argument
new_applier_function <- function(input, function_to_apply) {
  return(function_to_apply(input))
}

# sum vector with built-in & named function
new_applier_function(
  input = 1:2,              # input vector 
  function_to_apply = sum   # built-in & named function to apply
)   # returns 3

# sum vector with anonymous function
new_applier_function(
  input = 1:2,              # input vector 
  function_to_apply = function(input) {
    return(input[1] + input[2])
  } 
)   # returns 3 as well
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.11**

How many arguments should you pass to a function that...

a. ...tells if the sum of two numbers is even?

b. ...applies two different operations on a variable and sums the results? Operations are not fixed in the function. 

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">

a. Two arguments.

b. Three arguments.

</div>

## Loops and maps {#ch-01-01-loops-and-maps}

For iteratively performing computation steps, R has a special syntax for `for` loops. Here is an example of an (again, stupid, but illustrative) example of a `for` loop in R:

```{r}
# fix a vector to transform
input_vector <- 1:6

# create output vector for memory allocation
output_vector <- integer(length(input_vector))

# iterate over length of input
for (i in 1:length(input_vector)) {
  # multiply by 10 if even
  if (input_vector[i] %% 2 == 0) {
    output_vector[i] <- input_vector[i] * 10
  }
  else {
    output_vector[i] <- input_vector[i]
  }
}

output_vector
```

<div class = "exercises">
**Exercise 2.12**

Let's practice for-loops and if/else statements!
Create a vector `A` with 10 random integers from range (1:50). Create a second vector `B` that has the same length as vector `A`. Then fill vector `B` with the mean of A[(i-1):(i+1)] using a for-loop. Note that missing values are equal to 0 (see example below). Print out the result as a tibble. 
<br />
<br />
Example: If `A` has the values [25, 39, 12, 33, 47, 3, 48, 14, 45, 8], then vector `B` should contain the values [21, 25, 28, 31, 28, 33, 22, 36, 22, 18] when rounded to whole integers. The value in the fourth position of `B` (value 31), is obtained with (A[3] + A[4] + A[5])/3. The value in the first position of `B` (value 21) is obtained with (0 + A[1] + A[2])/3 and similarly the last value with (A[9] + A[10] + 0)/3.

<div class="collapsibleSolution">
<button class="trigger">Solution</button>
<div class="content">
```{r}

A <- c(sample((1:50), 10))
B <- c(integer(length(A)))

for (i in 1:length(A)){
  if (i == 1) {
    B[i] <- (sum(A[i:(i+1)])/3)
  } 
  else if (i == length(A)) {
    B[i] <- (sum((A[(i-1):i]))/3)
  }
  else {
    B[i] <- (mean(A[(i-1):(i+1)]))
  }
}

result <- tibble(A, B)

```

</div>
</div>
</div>

R also provides functional iterators (e.g., `apply`), but we will use the functional iterators from the `purrr` package. The main functional operator from `purrr` is `map` which takes a vector and a function, applies the function to each element in the vector and returns a list with the outcome. There are also versions of `map`, written as `map_dbl` (double), `map_lgl` (logical) or `map_df` (data frame), which return a vector of doubles, Booleans or a data frame. Here is a first example of how this code looks in a functional style using the functional iterator `map_dbl`:

```{r}
map_dbl(
  input_vector,
  function(i) {
    if (input_vector[i] %% 2 == 0) {
      return(input_vector[i] * 10)
    }
    else {
      return (input_vector[i])
    }
  }
)
```


We can write this even shorter, using `purrr`'s short-hand notation for functions:

```{r}
map_dbl(
  input_vector,
  ~ ifelse( .x %% 2 == 0, .x * 10, .x) 
)
```

The trailing `~` indicates that we define an anonymous function. It, therefore, replaces the usual `function(...)` call which indicates which arguments the anonymous function expects. To make up for this, after the `~` we can use `.x` for the first (and only) argument of our anonymous function.

To apply a function to more than one input vector, element per element, we can use `pmap` and its derivatives, like `pmap_dbl` etc. `pmap` takes a list of vectors and a function. In short-hand notation, we can define an anonymous function with `~` and integers like `..1`, `..2` etc, for the first, second ... argument. For example:

```{r}
x <- 1:3
y <- 4:6
z <- 7:9

pmap_dbl(
  list(x, y, z),
  ~ ..1 - ..2 + ..3
)
```

## Piping {#Chap-01-01-piping}

When we use a functional style of programming, piping is your best friend. Consider the standard example of applying functions in what linguists would call "center-embedding". We start with the input (written inside the inner-most bracketing), then apply the first function `round`, then the second `mean`, writing each next function call "around" the previous.

```{r}
# define input
input_vector <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)

# first round, then take mean
mean(round(input_vector))
```

Things quickly get out of hand when more commands are nested. A common practice is to store intermediate results of computations in new variables which are only used to pass the result into the next step.

```{r}
# define input
input_vector <- c(0.4, 0.5, 0.6)

# rounded input
rounded_input <- round(input_vector)

# mean of rounded input
mean(rounded_input)
```

Piping lets you pass the result of a previous function call into the next. The `magrittr` package supplies a special infix operator `%>%` for piping.^[The pipe symbol `%>%` can be inserted in RStudio with Ctrl+Shift+M (Win/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+M (Mac).] The pipe `%>%` essentially takes what results from evaluating the expression on its left-hand side and inputs it as the first argument in the function on its right-hand side. So `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`. Or, to continue the example from above, we can now write: 

```{r}
input_vector %>% round %>% mean
```



The functions defined as part of the tidyverse are all constructed in such a way that the first argument is the most likely input you would like to pipe into them. But if you want to pipe the left-hand side into another argument slot than the first, you can do that by using the `.` notation to mark the slot where the left-hand side should be piped into: `y %>% f(x, .)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`.
